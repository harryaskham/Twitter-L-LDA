*IMPORTANT: This was work done for my undergraduate Computer Science thesis in 2011, under extreme deadline pressure, and before I cut my teeth in industry :) it should work, but it's extremely messy and undocumented. I'm leaving this note as there have been quite a few stars/forks - caveat emptor*.
